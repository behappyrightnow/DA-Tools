# What does this app do?
This application utilizes cutting-edge mathematics created by Dr. Tom Keelin titled the [metalog distribution](http://metalogdistributions.com/) to add up forecasts of different pieces of work. Each piece of workÂ has three assessements on how long it takes to complete the work graded as low-medium-high. The assessments are done by asking the people involved in the work the following questions:
 * For this piece of work (or feature), what are some reasons to finish fast?
   * Document the reasoning 
 * Given the reasons you gave, how low is low? Give me a duration such that going any lower would make you fall off your chair in disbelief. This is the point at which you are wobbling."
   * If there are multiple people making the assessment, ask them to write it down to avoid groupthink, and then share the numbers with the facilitator. Take the smallest number in the group for this assessment.
